Hello! You just downloaded a trash.... bin?
Well, it not just a normal one but alive?
I made this bin because i was bored.
---------------------------------------------
For customization of trash bin, you have to get a 48x48 icon of bin (transparent)
and comments similar as comments.txt in comments.
If you made them, you have to put trashbin icon into icon, and make sure its named icon.png
and put your custom comments into comments folder, make sure its named comments.txt.
---------------------------------------------
If you messed up with trashbin icon,
you have to replace the modified files with their backups.
